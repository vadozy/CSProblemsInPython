## Versioning and Packages
The source code in this repository requires Python 3.7 and installation of the [typing_extensions](https://github.com/python/typing/tree/master/typing_extensions) package. Due to its extensive use of Python 3.7 features (data classes, advanced type hints, etc.), most of the source code will not work with earlier versions of Python. You can install the `typing_extensions` package with `pip3 install typing_extensions` or `pip install typing_extensions` depending on your Python/pip setup.

## Other Books and Languages
This is the second book in the Classic Computer Science Problems series by David Kopec and published by Manning. It aims to teach classic computer science problems in a Pythonic way. You may also want to checkout the first book in the series, *Classic Computer Science Problems in Swift*, which covers most of the same problems in a more Swifty way. You can check out the repository for that book on [GitHub as well](https://github.com/davecom/ClassicComputerScienceProblemsInSwift). A reader has also reimplemented the first five chapters of the book [in C++](https://github.com/araya-andres/classic_computer_sci).
